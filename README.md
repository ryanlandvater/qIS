## Introduction
The following repository outlines the implementation of quantitative immunosubtraction for serum protein electrophoresis (*SPEP*) as a method for highly accurate and precise quantification of M-proteins rather than vertical drop or horizontal skim approximations. 

## Format
The project prototype is written in python as in the Jupyter Notebook with appropriate annotations.

## Implementation
Future.
